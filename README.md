# Stardew Valley Construction Calculator (SVCC)
## Why
SVCC is a small program designed to help you plan construction and resources for your next Stardew Valley project. Let's say you wanted to build a shed, and had already gathered *some* of the wood and stone needed to build it. You've already spent most of your money on seeds for the season, so how much *exactly* do you need to spend if you were to purchase the remaining wood/stone for your building? SVCC answers exactly that question.

## Goals And The Future

Currently, SVCC only calculates a final number of gold needed to finish a building. Eventually however, I'd like to get it to the point where it can help you plan out projects, save material lists, and maybe even port it to a mobile app (where I predict it would find more use). I'm always looking for suggestions and welcome and bug reports/feature requests anyone is willing to send.

## Contributing

So here's the thing, I'm somewhat of a `junior--;` developer. I have 0 professional software development experience, and I could *always* use help with this. Translations, documentation, new features, bug fixs, refactoring, ect. You name it, I need help with it. So long as your pull request is clean and moderatly well documented, it'll probably get merged.
